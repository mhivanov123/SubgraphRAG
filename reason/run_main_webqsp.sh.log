To find the answer to the question, we need to find the triplets related to Niels Bohr and his contributions to atomic structure.

From the triplets, we can see that Niels Bohr discovered the Bohr model of the atom, which describes the arrangement of electrons in an atom.

The Bohr model is a model that describes the structure of atoms as having a small, dense nucleus with electrons in specific energy levels or shells. The model was first proposed by Niels Bohr in 1913 and later refined by John Dalton and others.

The key features of the Bohr model include:

* The nucleus is at the center of the atom and contains protons and neutrons.
* Electrons occupy specific energy levels or shells around the nucleus.
* Electrons jump from one energy level to another by emitting or absorbing energy in the form of light.
